this school in Egypt, Excellent school with a supportive community. 
The teachers are caring and the school environment is safe and welcoming. 
The learning programs are strong, and there are plenty of chances for students 
to get involved in various activities. highly recommend!",


"The school is okay. Some teachers are really good, 
but others seem disengaged. The administration is responsive, 
but there are too many rules and not enough focus on creativity. 
The cafeteria food could be better. Overall, 
it's a decent school but there is room for improvement.",3


Great school with dedicated teachers. 
The curriculum is challenging but rewarding. 
The sports facilities are excellent and the extracurricular activities offer something for everyone. 
My child has thrived here and we are very happy with the education they are receiving.,5
